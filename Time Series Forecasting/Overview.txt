ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. It depends on below paramter
P -> If current value is dependedent on previous values. If yes, how many values are to be considered
    The significant lags can be found using PACF

D -> The series has a trend associated with it. You remove the impact of trend by difference. 
    We need to share the level of different that removes the impact of trend
    Dicky Fuller test can be used to check if the series is stationary or not

Q -> The current value also uses past error to calculate the current value. It shows how many errors are to be considered in this scenario
    The siginicant lags can be determined using ACF


Once we have P, D and Q values, we can build the ARIMA model using those parameters.
Auto_ARIMA is an automated way of finding the best parameters for ARIMA model by trying out different combinations of P, D and Q 
and selecting the best one based on AIC/BIC values.
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) are statistical measures used to compare different models and select the best one.
AIC = -2ln(L) + 2k
BIC = -2ln(L) + k * ln(n)
Where L is the likelihood of the model and k is the number of parameters and n is the number of observations (sample size)
The likelihood of the model indicates how well the model fits the data.
    $$\ell(\theta) = -\frac{T}{2} \ln(2\pi) - \frac{T}{2} \ln(\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \epsilon_t^2$$
    $T$: Number of observations.
    $\sigma^2$: Variance of the errors.
    $\epsilon_t$: The residual (actual value minus predicted value).

The ARIMA equation so formed is then validated with Ljung-Box test to check if the residual errors are white noise or not.
